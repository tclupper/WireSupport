## Electric Fence Wire support (attaches to wood)

### Notes:
* No supports needed
* Use a plastic material that will withstand the temperatures and weather conditions outdoors
* This is attached to wood using a standard #10 wood screw
* The wire is held in the slot using [standard 3/16 inch wide plastic cable ties {0.053 inch thick}](https://www.harborfreight.com/4-in-white-cable-ties-100-pk-60257.html)

## Extra Notes:
* For the first run of the parts I used standard PLA (I had it loaded in my Monoprice Mini Delta).  You can see that the grey part above is warping from the sun.  I would recommend not using PLA and use Nylon or PETG instead.
* You will notice that the designs have slots where you can use plastic cable ties to secure the wire in the slot.  I would highly recommend doing this to keep the wire from popping out of the slot.
